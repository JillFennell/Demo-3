# Demo 3


Hello everyone!
This week we completed our first portfolio's, and here I would like to compile a few tips that were useful to me as I did this assignment.
The main issue that I encountered was that I couldnt figure out how to add in a theme, and then make my portfolio look more like a website. Below are a few trouble shooting options that helped me.

The first issue I faced was applying a theme to my repo. You can find the link [here](demo3_screenshot.pdf) to see the steps I used to apply a Theme to my repo.
1. First I clicked on the pencil icon in top right hand corner to add my text to be presented. 
2. Once my text was added, I clicked settings and scrolled down to find the 'GitHub Pages' section.
3. In this section I selected 'Choose a theme'
4. I looked through the themes and selected 'Midnight' for this demo.
5. Finally, I went back through settings and scrolled down to the 'GitHub Pages' section and it provided me with a link which directs me to a nicely formatted website.

The next issue I ran into was that I couldn't figure out how to make my code stand out from the rest of the text. The solution was to start working in a new cell and have the cell type as "code"

First, I made 'code' cells in a jupyter notebook that I wanted to bring into my repo. 

Next, I imported the code as a notebook download from the jupyter notebook.

I downloaded the notebook into my repo, and then linked it in square brackets followed by round brackets which contained the file name.

[Here is what the code looks like when you import it](Demo_3.ipynb) 

Thank you for reading, happy coding!
