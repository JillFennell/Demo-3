# Demo 3


Hello everyone!
This week we completed our first portfolio's, and here I would like to compile a few tips that were useful to me as I did this assignment.
The main issue that I encountered was that I couldnt figure out how to add in a theme, and then make my portfolio look more like a website. Below are a few trouble shooting options that helped me.

The first issue I ran into was that I couldnt figure out how to make my code stand out from the rest of the text. The solution was to start working in a new cell and have the cell type as "code"
First, I made 'code' cells in a jupyter notebook that I wanted to bring into my repo. 

next, I imported the code as a markdown download from the jupyter notebook.

[Here is what the code looks like when you import it](Demo_3.md.webarchive)
